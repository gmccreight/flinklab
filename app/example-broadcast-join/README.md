### What is example-broadcast-join?

#### The Goal

You should be able to cd into this directory, run `000_all.sh`, and it will
compile and run a job that joins a keyed stream (TODO, right
name?) and a broadcast stream (TODO, right name?)

It also verifies that the processing is working correctly.

### Assumptions

You have docker installed and running.

### Resources

The code came from:

https://github.com/streaming-with-flink/examples-scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/io/github/streamingwithflink/chapter7/BroadcastStateFunction.scala
