### What is example-broadcast-join?

#### The Goal

You should be able to cd into this directory, run `000_all.sh`, and it will
compile and run a job that joins a broadcast stream with another stream.

It also verifies that the processing is working correctly.

### Assumptions

You have docker installed and running.

### Resources

The code came from:
