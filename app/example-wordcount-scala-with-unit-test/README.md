### What is quickstart?

#### The Goal

You should be able to cd into this directory, run `000_all.sh`, and it should
compile a WordCount jar.  Then it will run some unit tests.  Finally, it
should start a Flink cluster on your local machine, run the WordCountData job,
and report some results.

### Assumptions

You have docker-compose installed and docker running.

### Details and Motivation

This is mostly the same as in quickstart-scala, so check out that Readme for details about motivation.
