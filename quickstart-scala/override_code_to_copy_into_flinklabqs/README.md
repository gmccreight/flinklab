The WordCount example code comes from

https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/examples/scala/wordcount/WordCount.scala

The paths have been changed.

There is no WordCountData scala version, and I don't want to use the Java version, so I ported it to Scala by hand.

This was a little challenging because there are no static members in Scala
