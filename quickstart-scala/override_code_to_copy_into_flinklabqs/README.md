The WordCount example code comes from

https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/examples/scala/wordcount/WordCount.scala

The paths have been changed.

There is no WordCountData scala version, and I don't want to use the Java
version, so I inlined the data, since I couldn't figure out how to use data
from another file.
